##The Nike Shoe Tester App is built using the following technologies:

React Native: A JavaScript library used to build native mobile applications
Expo: A set of tools and services for building, deploying, and testing React Native apps
Axios: A Promise-based HTTP client used to make API calls to the server
React Navigation: A routing and navigation library used to handle navigation within the app
The app also connects to a Nike Shoes API to retrieve the latest shoe releases.

##Installation
To install the Nike Shoe Tester App, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine: git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/nike-shoe-tester.git
Install the required dependencies using npm: npm install
Start the development server: npm start
Note: In order to view the app on your mobile device, you will need to have the Expo app installed on your phone. You can download it from the App Store or Google Play.

#Usage
Once the development server is running, you can use the Expo app on your phone to scan the QR code displayed in the terminal or in the browser window that opens when you run npm start. This will launch the Nike Shoe Tester App on your phone.

From there, you can browse the latest Nike shoe releases, track your orders, and experience an ecommerce-like platform.
